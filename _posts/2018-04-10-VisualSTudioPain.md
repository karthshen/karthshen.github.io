## A Couple words ##

So when you really want to get rid of Visual Studio, or if you need to completely, **COMPLETELY** uninstall and reinstall Visual Studio for some specific reason (In my case, to change the default installation location, the installation location was greyed out on my machine), you can try the following tool.

- https://github.com/Microsoft/VisualStudioUninstaller/releases

This tool will uninstall everything that's related to Visual Studio 2015 on your computer (this may work for 2017 as well), including but not limited to the IDE, MySQL components, registries and .Net components. 

You should only use this tool as your last hope, because it unreasonably uninstalls alot of essential components on your computer, like the .Net components and SDKs. 

If you can't fix your problem with this tool, try find a doctor or smash your computer or keyboard. 

Good luck as always.
