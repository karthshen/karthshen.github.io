# What Happened #
The `brew cask install java` installed Java 10 on my computer, and some of my libraries ran into problems with Java 10 as the default JAVA_HOME Directory. 

Installing with `brew cask install java8` didn't help, because though it installs Java 8 on my Mac, it couldn't change the default JAVA_HOME location. 

# Solution for the Issue #
After running into a few compatibility problems with my applications, I ended up using 
```
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`
```

1. Run the above shell command in the terminal should resolve the Java compatibility issue for this terminal session.
2. Attach the above command in ` ~/.bash_profile ` should change the default location for JAVA_HOME. 
3. If the default version for Java needs to be something different, just adjust the parameter at the end of the command accordingly.
