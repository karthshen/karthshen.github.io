### A little thought ###

So I started to dig into technical blog after I realized that I learn alot of things everyday, but I also forget about them very quickly. 

When I find out how to resolve a bug, I get happy, and when I see it again, I knew I resolved this bug earlier but I may forget the exact procedure, and I get angry and depressed.

So, to avoid the depression, here we are, a blog that basically records all of my thoughts that relates to software engineering and game developing. 

I hope you would enjoy this blog, I mean I probably won't bother to maintain or even build its quality.

Also a shout out to Hux for making this template, you are the best.
