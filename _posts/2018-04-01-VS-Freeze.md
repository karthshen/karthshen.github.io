## Issue ##

Visual Studio 2015, while switching debug mode and debug type (From development to debug, for example), freezes constantly, and usually takes up to minutes to recover.

## Fix (?) ##
- This fix is not completely proven to work yet, but it seems helpful

Try to delete 
``` C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0```
directory, and restart Visual Studio.
This solution seems to be working, but it is still sad that Microsoft may have corruptted its own files with VS running.
